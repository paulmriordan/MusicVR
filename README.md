# MusicVR

Prototyping an idea for a 360 music sequencer, for VR headsets

Inspired by TiltBrush, I wanted to make a VR music experience where you can see and edit music around you.

For music synthesis, I have utilised and extended [Unity CSharpSynth ](https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unitysynth-full-xplatform-midi-synth.130104/)

## Development Progress

### Completed
- Proof of concept (currently works in desktop and mobile) with multiple instrument sections, and abilty to navigate and edit composition
- Configurable instrument scales (pentatonic, major, minor, chromatic)
- Drum instrument types
- Saving/loading compositions
- Basic visualisaions; HDR button effects, lighting from play position marker, skybox

### In Progress
- VR friendly UI

### Future goals
- Build project for VR and handle VR input
- Configurable rythm swing level 
- Improve visualization; better buttons assets, skybox, add other visual effects 
- Loading custom SFZ instruments
- Importing/exporting midi projects; allow users to edit composition externally, then experience them in VR
- Sharing of compositions between users
- Allow portamento synth instruments; allow user to draw a continuous line around themselves
