	// See http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnAudioFilterRead.html for reference code
	//	If OnAudioFilterRead is implemented, Unity will insert a custom filter into the audio DSP chain.
	//
	//	The filter is inserted in the same order as the MonoBehaviour script is shown in the inspector. 	
	//	OnAudioFilterRead is called everytime a chunk of audio is routed thru the filter (this happens frequently, every ~20ms depending on the samplerate and platform). 
	//	The audio data is an array of floats ranging from [-1.0f;1.0f] and contains audio from the previous filter in the chain or the AudioClip on the AudioSource. 
	//	If this is the first filter in the chain and a clip isn't attached to the audio source this filter will be 'played'. 
	//	That way you can use the filter as the audio clip, procedurally generating audio.
	//
	//	If OnAudioFilterRead is implemented a VU meter will show up in the inspector showing the outgoing samples level. 
	//	The process time of the filter is also measured and the spent milliseconds will show up next to the VU Meter 
	//	(it turns red if the filter is taking up too much time, so the mixer will starv audio data). 
	//	Also note, that OnAudioFilterRead is called on a different thread from the main thread (namely the audio thread) 
	//	so calling into many Unity functions from this function is not allowed ( a warning will show up ).
